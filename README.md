# Red-Team-Blue-Team
This project allowed me to act as both an attacker and a defender against the attack. 
Red Team: looking for misconfigurations and possible vulnerabilities to attack.
Blue Team: looking at log information to determine what vulnerabilities were found, how the attacker exploited those vulnerabilities, and how to prevent systems from future attacks.
