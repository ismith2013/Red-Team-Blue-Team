# Red-Team-Blue-Team
This project allowed me to act as both an attacker and a defender against the attack. 

As a member of the red team, I was able to look for misconfigurations within the system and possible vulnerabilities to attack.

As a member of the blue team, I looked at log information to determine what vulnerabilities were found, how the attacker exploited those vulnerabilities, and determined how to prevent systems from future attacks.
